# Kisaan Saathi Project


# Problem:
In rural areas, hardworking small-scale farmers struggle daily to make a living.

They lack access to vital market and pricing information, which hampers their ability to earn more, make smart choices, and escape exploitation. 

The challenge is clear: these farmers need real-time data and fair access to market insights. 

They often operate with limited resources, unaware of current market conditions, which results in less profitable crop decisions and unfair pricing. 

The solution is to provide a platform that levels the playing field, empowering small-scale farmers with the information they need to prosper.
